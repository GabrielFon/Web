I have made many projects with Python as well. I learned python in two of my classes at UT. However, I have also used it outside of classwork. The following program I made uses the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to compute a vector orthonormal to two other vectors in R2, which can be then used to find approximate solutions for inconsistent systems. Of course, there exists calculators that do this, but I enjoyed making this program for my own use in linear algebra. 

```{python}
def dot(v, u):

    product = 0
    for i in range(len(v)):
        product = (v[i] * u[i]) + product

    return product

def multiply(scalar, v):

    u = list()
    for i in range(len(v)):
        product = v[i]*scalar
        u.append(product)
    return u

def subtract(v, u):

    w = list()
    for i in range(len(v)):
        diff = v[i] - u[i]
        w.append(diff)
    return w

def main():

    u = [-1,1,2,1,1]
    v = [5,1,3,2,8]
    scalar = (dot(v,u))/(dot(u,u))
    second = multiply(scalar, u)
    print(subtract(v, second))
    print(scalar)

main()


```
